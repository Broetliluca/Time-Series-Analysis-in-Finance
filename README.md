## DATA
 **icap-graph-price 2019-2025**
 Co2 allowance price data from the EU ETS

**Description**
The Carbon Price Viewer shows the historical price of European allowances (EUA), i.e. the price of emitting 1 tonne of CO2-equivalent for a European industrial installation or airline covered by the Emissions Trading System. It does not mean that this price is always paid by polluters, as many of them receive free allowances. 

EUAs are traded between buyers and sellers, either directly “over the counter” or via organised markets. They can be traded either with immediate delivery (spot) or with delivery in the future, usually at slightly different prices. Up until December 2009, the price shown is based on spot-month continuous contract calculation. After that date, it corresponds to auction settlement prices, from the European Energy Exchange AG.
