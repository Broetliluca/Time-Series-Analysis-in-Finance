Helpful Comments from Chatty to use MSCI ETF Data

✅ Why this dataset is useful for your analysis

To study whether EU ETS allowance prices influence a sustainable ETF, you need historical time series of the ETF’s:

NAV per Share (Net Asset Value)

Fund Return Series (total return index of the ETF)

Benchmark Return Series (optional but helpful for comparison)

Shares Outstanding (useful for detecting inflows/outflows)

Total Net Assets (size over time)

Your downloaded data contains exactly that.

✔️ What each column means (in simple terms)
Column	Why it’s useful
As Of	Date — essential for merging with ETS carbon price data
NAV per Share	Price of 1 ETF share — your primary dependent variable
Shares Outstanding	Shows new ETF units created/redeemed (primary market activity)
Total Net Assets	ETF size (NAV × Shares Outstanding)
Fund Return Series	A clean percentage-return index, often easier to use than raw NAV
Benchmark Return Series	To compare ETF vs. Index behaviour
⭐ How you will use this in your regression / analysis

You will:

Merge
Merge this ETF data with your EU ETS daily price series by date.

Create returns (if using NAV):
"some math"

Use daily log returns:
Or use Fund Return Series (already cumulative), convert to daily returns.

Run regression(s)

1️⃣ Positive effect hypothesis (green exposure)

ETF return = a + b · ETS_price_change + controls

b > 0 means ETS price increases improve sustainable ETF performance.

2️⃣ Negative effect hypothesis (carbon-intensive assets)

Repeat the same with a “brown ETF”.

Expect b < 0.

⚠️ Note on the -- entries

These usually occur when:

The fund was closed for valuation

The return index wasn’t updated for that day

You can safely drop or interpolate those few days.

✔️ Conclusion

Yes — this dataset is exactly the historical ETF data you need for analyzing correlations or causal effects between EU ETS prices and Paris-Aligned ETF performance.

If you want, I can:

help you clean the data,

convert it into returns,

merge with your ETS price CSV,

or even run the full regression model with you.
